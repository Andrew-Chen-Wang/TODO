- Need Spotify developer access. I created a new app, so this probably means I need a server...
- But I'd much rather just have someone who has Python to just clone the repo and do it him/herself.
- Use a bunch of `input` to make it work I suppose (prob better than with argparser)

This probably means that in order to use this, you would need BOTH a Spotify and YouTube account
since I'm not hosting a server with a dedicated account to doing this. A little but of a hassle
I suppose. This isn't exactly an mp3 YouTube download thing. We're just duplicating playlists.
