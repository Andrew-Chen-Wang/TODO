The inspiration is serious; the facts about me just playing Wii games is not true. I played a lot
of computer games when I was little, but completely stopped by 4th grade. YouTube had attracted
my attention quite a bit. But the inspiration was from the Art of War and my lack of knowledge
on the Cold War. Many people love the Art of War because of how close it is to human life
and human psychology (which I love). Regarding espionage in the Cold War, I know very little
about it, but I've always wanted to write about Urban Warfare tactics. This can be a nice 
start I suppose. I just know so little about the Cold War, even after taking an AP class
on American history: it sucks not knowing about this turmoil.

Now regarding the actual idea of Audiobook to Video format to attract people's attention. This
should become a business ~~but Sentry style: open source.~~ Can't do Sentry style since resources
are crucial in the money making process. The thing is, I want to publish the videos on YouTube...

Ok now for the actual idea:

Why videos? They are attention grabbing, with images and dramatic points using music, not just some
person's voice.

- General: User inputs audiobook. We need context of what this is about. Use key terms via the token terms
in the provided text (the actual book) and use that to look up images in Google images or other
CC licensed images.
- Music: same thing. Identify times of drama, tension, etc. This can also be identified through the
audio book narrator with a different ML model.
- Shortening: the entire audiobook should not be read. Each video should only be 12-15 mintues (enough
for ad revenue but also enough to get people interested for a decently long series (long in my opinion)).
25 minutes might be too much if there aren't enough interesting/dramatic points in the books. Which is
a problem because most books aren't trailers: it's not all drama and for sure tension is not there
for an entire book. I don't want authors to write books differently either. We want to get enough
buildup, enough drama, and just enough for a conclusion, but not too large of a conclusion. Conclusions
in videos are short, so we also make that short. We need to identify good times in a book for lapses
in drama. This is to make sure tension is not maintained for too long to be normalized.
- Number of videos: we need enough information to keep attention long enough and but we don't want
to just reach 10 videos (optimal for clients making ad revenue, sorta, but you also want views
to get that ad revenue).

This inspiration is from YT Dream's Minecraft 3v1 Manhunt videos :) It's nice listening to screams
while programming and reading emails lmao.

Maybe have people convert their audiobooks to videos (with the service for automation) at a certain
price. They earn ad revenue; I earn direct revenue.

Why won't this actually happen? I suck at video creation. Someone with trailer power can do this.
Someone with money can do this. I'm interested but know I'll forget about it so the idea is now
in public domain.
