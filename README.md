Ideas I'd like to make

 - [ ] Spotify to YouTube: find all the songs on my Spotify playlist and load them into YouTube playlist (on my account) or return a list of urls. Maybe also works with artists?
 - [ ] Introduce coding to a beloved city... in which K-12 schools have to cancel classes and schools in general are becoming empty...
 - [ ] Broadcast encryption would make group stuff private and low-cost in storage. What if we thought of the encryption method as a mother with twins, triplets, etc.? Think of a pie chart in which "mother" is the host who holds 50% of the keys via reversible PRNG address from the same concept of Library of Babel
