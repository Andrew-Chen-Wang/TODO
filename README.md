Ideas I'd like to make

 - [ ] Spotify to YouTube: find all the songs on my Spotify playlist and load them into YouTube playlist (on my account) or return a list of urls. Maybe also works with artists?
 - [ ] Introduce coding to a beloved city... in which K-12 schools have to cancel classes and schools in general are becoming empty...
 - [ ] Broadcast encryption would make group stuff private and low-cost in storage. What if we thought of the encryption method as a mother with twins, triplets, etc.? Think of a pie chart in which "mother" is the host who holds 50% of the keys via reversible PRNG address from the same concept of Library of Babel
 - [ ] Paper: why is it easier to encourage than to stop/discourage? In the conclusion, state "Let's flip the equation. Why is it harder to stop than to encourage?" For example, drinking and driving or "doing drugs" has been denounced after many famous people started dying early from cigarettes. Or with Reagan's (or was it Nixon?) step up to drinking and driving.. oof, remembering "The War on Drugs" phrase... Another example is how media personalities can encourage the usage of something (e.g. President Trump encouraging the usage of hydroxychloroquine or beauty YouTubers encouraging the use of a product).
 - [ ] Machine learning project: turn audio books about history into entertaining short video series (either two videos, 5, or up to 10 videos). Good enough to get the main topics by adding in music, good pictures or animations, and making sure the logic of the book is good enough to be published. [Inspired by COD Cold War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsBRGCabaog); I've never played anything but Wii sports and Wii Super Mario; never listened to an audiobook before; I love educational YouTube videos and anything on YouTube talking about history and politics (in an interesting way that is). Let's do this :)
